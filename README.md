# How to open: 
                  To start the program, please go to "Game of Life/Kunde" and run the "beleg prog.exe".
                  Otherwise you can open the Project in Visual Studio.
                  
# How to use:   
                
                  Menu: 
                  
                  1 Run with starting position loaded from a file                  
                  2 Run with a random starting position                  
                  3 Exit the program
                  
                  If you choose one you can pick a file to start with.
                  If you choose two you can fill in how many cells should be alive from the start.
                  
                  The program will always ask you if you want the sequence to be autoplayed or if you want 
                  to iterate through each generation manually.
